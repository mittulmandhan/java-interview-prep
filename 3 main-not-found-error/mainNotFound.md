# Main Not Found Error

If JVM does not find the main method in your class at runtime it throws a runtime exception.


suppose we have a class which doesn't have a main method.
- It will compile successfully by javac MainNotFoundErrorDemo.java command
- But on Runtime JVM will not find mainmethod in it and will throw an Error.

````
class MainNotFoundErrorDemo {
	
}
````
